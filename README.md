## Last Moments

An interactive comic.

Last Moments is an audiovisual exploration of the fleeting and delicate nature of life. The story follows 3 characters having their last-ever interactions with an unnamed protagonist, while completely unaware of this fact. The comic's serious and reflective nature asks the reader to contemplate the abruptness with which life can end, and perhaps gain a greater appreciation for it as a result.

### Process
The project started to take shape when we came up with the idea of last moments. Following this, we wanted to do two things: 1. write a meaningful story, and 2. translate that story into a meaningful webpage.

To write a meaningful story, we chose characters and scenes that augmented the message. The first character, the long-time friend, meets the protagonist after a long time. Their interaction is a normal, everyday meeting that anyone might have with a friend. The mood is light-hearted and jovial. This scene represents the blissful ignorance people can have in their last moments with someone.

The second character, the boss, has a professional relationship with the protagonist. While the boss might have forged a friendship with the protagonist over time, the crux of their relationship is still work-related. By firing the protagonist, the boss reminds us that the people we interact with on a professional level also have their own emotionally complex lives.

The last character, the wife, has a deep and personal relationship with the protagonist. She snaps at him when she learns about his unemployment, completely unaware of what is about to happen to him. The wife represents the most painful aspect of last moments: regret.

As for the comic and webpage themselves, we went with a generally gloomy and reflective vibe. The comic draws from the noir comic tradition, drawn in black and white and with a degree of realism. The website uses next to no color, aside from some muted blues. 

To present the comic itself, we chose to implement it as a book using turn.js. The book has a hardcover and resembles a tome, which fits the more serious vibe of the comic. We also added sound on-click for the pages to add more immersion for the reader.

### Reflection
In hindsight, this was a fairly heavy and serious concept for a class project. Because of that, the degree of care needed to effectively bring the concept to life was quite a bit more than we expected. 

Turn.js also caused a lot of weird bugs that had weird solutions, so that's a lesson about the pitfalls of relying on libraries that aren't widely used.
